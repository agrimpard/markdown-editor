## Markdown editor

As its name suggests, "Markdown editor" is a content editor allowing to format text with markdown syntax.

This editor allows to display in the same window a classic wysiwyg text editor and a text field displaying markdown content. It is possible to edit the content on both sides.

The editor allows you to open a file with markdown content and save it in the same file after editing.

"Markdown editor" uses CKEditor, Bootstrap and Jquery. It is a basic PHP script, you can modify the `index.php` file and especially the `$file_path` variable to start using it.

### Going further

In my personal use of this script, I added the possibility to fetch a markdown file wherever it can be found on the system. You have a base, it's up to you to modify this script as you wish so that it can meet your needs.
